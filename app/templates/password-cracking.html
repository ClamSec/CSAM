    <h3>Password Cracking</h3>
    <p >
        Password cracking is the process of discovering computer passwords. There are two approaches to cracking passwords:
        brute force and dictionary attacks. Brute force attacks work by trying every possible combination of characters
        that could be the password. This takes time, but you are guaranteed to find an answer eventually. 
        Dictionary attacks work by enumerating a dictionary of common words and checking to see if the password is in the dictionary.
        This has the advantage of being faster, but it is possible the password is not in the dictionary and will not be found.
    </p>
    <h5>Try common dictionary words or low complexity passwords to see how quickly they can be cracked. </br>
        Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the dictionary attack vs the brute force attack.</h5>
